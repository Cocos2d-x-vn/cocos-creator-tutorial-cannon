# Step 06: Create the ground

In this step all the heavy lifiting happend out of the Cocos Creator.

I got some tile maps from opengameart.com again and created a tiled map using Tiled map editor.
Then i added the map to the Cocos Creator project and wrote a few lines of code.

And, finally, created a node on the scene with the map. Thats all. No code.
