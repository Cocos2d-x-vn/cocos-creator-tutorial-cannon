# Conculsion

There is a pretty much work behind and i am pretty satisfied with the result.

Now we can defend the Earth!

In the tutorial we touched these concepts in the Cocos Creator:
- Sprite component to render sprites
- Chipmunk physics with bodies, shapes, gravity and collision callbacks
- Tile map sprite to render tiled maps
- Scheduler to schedule callback leveraging the Cocos Creator engine
- Animation to play sprite animations
- AudioClip to play sound effects
- Prefabs to create preset nodes dynamically
- EventManager to hook input events
